# Win10-Initial-Setup-Script-presets

Presets for https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script

For three types of Windows 10 images:

- Normal: Everyday use
- Dev: Development VM - assumes there's only the built-in Administrator user
- Hacking: Pentest/Security VM - some built-in security features are turned off to make it easier to work with "malicious" binaries
